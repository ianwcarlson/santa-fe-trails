# Option A
This is a great way to ride around the city through a mix of rolling hills, minimal traffic, and some long gravel sections. The east side of the route weaves through Sol Y Lomas, Museum Hill, St. Johns, Upper Canyon Road, Cerra Gordo, Sierra Del Norte. The west side of the route heads through Tano Road, La Tierra, Casa Solana, Aqua Fria over to Cerrillos (which can be the most confusing to navigate through), and the Santa Fe Rail Trail. The whole ride has nice views of the mountains and hills of Santa Fe.

The are some different options for this ride. Depending on how much dirt you want to experience, you can choose to ride some parts of Dale Ball system, particularly the north section, which is doable for most adventure bikes. You can also dabble in the mid-section, but there will be a few sections you may need to walk. As shown in the map, you can cut through the mid-section of Dale Ball to ride through a pleasant, but somewhat desolate Cerros Colorados neighborhood.

The west side of town has some options as well. Depending on when you start heading south (from the counter-clockwise direction), once you cross Aqua Fria you can take the River Trail, cross Cerrillos at Camino Carlos Rey and head south, and then take the Arroyo Chamisa trail to the Rail Trail. There's no easy way to cross Cerrillos, so most options in that area of town are driven by Cerrillos crossing areas.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
